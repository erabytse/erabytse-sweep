# ðŸ§¹ erabytse-sweep  
*A ritualistic tool to recycle digital clutter with intention.*

> "Before you delete, ask: does this deserve to be remembered differently?"

## ðŸŒ¿ Philosophy
- We do not erase. We **recontextualize**.  
- We do not automate blindly. We **invite intention**.  
- Every sweep is a **ritual of care**, not a purge.

## âœ¨ Features (v0.1)
- Finds files untouched for >90 days  
- Shows size, date, and examples  
- Creates a **human-readable journal** (`.erabytse_journal.json`)  
- **100% offline, no tracking, no AI**  
- Pure Python â€” no external dependencies

Part of **[erabytse](https://erabytse.github.io)** â€” a quiet rebellion against digital waste.

Made with care, not with noise.
